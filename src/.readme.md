- `lib` contains your library code (utilities and components), which can be imported via the [$lib](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/$lib) alias, or packaged up for distribution using [svelte-package](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/packaging)

  - `server` contains your server-only library code. It can be imported by using the $lib/server alias. SvelteKit will prevent you from importing these in client code.

- `params` contains any [param matchers](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/advanced-routing#Matching) your app needs

- `routes` contains the [routes](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/routing) of your application. You can also colocate other components that are only used within a single route here

- `app.html` is your page template — an HTML document containing the following placeholders:

  - `%sveltekit.head%` — `<link>` and `<script>` elements needed by the app, plus any `<svelte:head>` content
  - ``%sveltekit.body%`— the markup for a rendered page. This should live inside a `<div>` or other element, rather than directly inside `<body>`, to prevent bugs caused by browser extensions injecting elements that are then destroyed by the hydration process. SvelteKit will warn you in development if this is not the case
  - `%sveltekit.assets%` — either [paths.assets](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/configuration#paths), if specified, or a relative path to [paths.base](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/configuration#paths)
  - `%sveltekit.nonce%` — a [CSP](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/configuration#csp) nonce for manually included links and scripts, if used
  - `%sveltekit.env.[NAME]%` - this will be replaced at render time with the [NAME] environment variable, which must begin with the [publicPrefix](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/configuration#env) (usually PUBLIC\_). It will fallback to '' if not matched.

- `error.html` is the page that is rendered when everything else fails. It can contain the following placeholders:

  - `%sveltekit.status%` — the HTTP status
  - `%sveltekit.error.message%` — the error message

- `hooks.client.js` contains your client [hooks](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/hooks)
- `hooks.server.js` contains your server [hooks](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/hooks)
- `service-worker.js` contains your service [worker](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/service-workers)
